This is a curated selection of side projects I've worked on independently, outside of my regular work for personal learning and growth. These projects are the result of my pursuit of learning, knowledge sharing, and participation in hackathons and game jams.

Gemini Movie Detectives is an innovative web application using Gemini to create an engaging, AI-driven educational gaming experience. It showcases Gemini's potential in education through four distinct game modes:

- **Title Detectives**: AI-generated movie title riddles from real-time The Movie Database (TMDB) data.
- **Sequel Salad**: Gemini crafts plots for fictional sequels and generates prompts for fake movie posters created by the Google Imagen model.
- **Back to the Future Trivia**: Combining AI with Wikipedia, this mode generates up-to-date multiple-choice questions. Christopher Lloyd would be proud!
- **Movie Fun Facts**: Merging TMDB and Wiki data for accurate trivia content.

All modes use Google's Text-to-Speech API and a modular prompt generation system, allowing users to choose AI personalities, including the hilarious "Dad Jokes Dad"!

Google's AI and developer tools are used for dynamic content generation, nuanced language understanding, and contextual awareness, demonstrating potential for engaging learning apps.

The tech stack, combining FastAPI, VueJS, Firebase for user profiles, metadata, and authentication, and Vertex AI, showcases a scalable approach to AI-powered development.

Movie Detectives tackles the challenge of maintaining student interest, improving knowledge retention, and making learning enjoyable. It's not just a movie quiz; itâ€™s a glimpse into AI-enhanced education, pushing boundaries for accessible, engaging, and effective learning experiences.
